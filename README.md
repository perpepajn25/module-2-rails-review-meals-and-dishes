# Rails CRUD and Association Group Review

## Tasks
### Build out regular CRUD and form_for Meal

  * Team One - Build the new/create controller methods with validation for name presence and uniqueness.  Build out form_for for new

  * Team Two - Build the edit/update controller methods with validation for name presence and uniqueness.  Build out form_for for edit

### Push up work - As a group, refactor this to have one form for both new and edit.  Copy created code to Dish, changing class references.

  * Build out one form_for Meal form that will allow you to assign a existing dish to a Meal.  

  * Build out Meal show page to display all dishes in the meal

  * Build out method for controlling Dish type to limit it to ('main', 'vegetarian', 'side', 'dessert')
